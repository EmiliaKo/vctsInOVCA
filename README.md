Virtual clinical trials simulations in high grade serous ovarian cancer

The MATLAB code to run virtual clinical trials simulations for high grade serous ovarian cancer. The code is supplementary material for the publication titled: 
"Virtual clinical trials identify effective combination therapies in ovarian cancer"

The abstract of the paper: 

A major issue in oncology is the high failure rate of translating preclinical results into successful clinical trials. Using virtual clinical trial simulations approach, we present a mathematical framework to estimate the added value of combinatorial treatments in ovarian cancer. This approach was applied to identify effective targeted therapies that can be combined with the platinum-taxane regimen and overcome platinum resistance in high-grade serous ovarian cancer. We modeled and evaluated the effectiveness of three drugs that target the major platinum resistance mechanisms, which have shown promising efficacy in vitro, in vivo, and in early clinical trials. Our results show that drugs that resensitize chemoresistant cells are superior to those aimed at triggering apoptosis or increasing the bioavailability of platinum. Our results further show that the benefit of using biomarker stratification in clinical trials is dependent on the efficacy of the drug and tumor composition. The mathematical framework presented herein is suitable for systematically testing various drug combinations and clinical trial designs in solid cancers.

The paper is currently under review.
